Getting Started:

  1. Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc
  2. CsvHelper
  3. Newtonsoft.Json
- Build and run the application.
- Use a tool like Postman or curl to send HTTP POST requests to the "api/gwp/avg" endpoint with the required JSON payload.

Ensure that the CSV file ("gwpByCountry.csv") is present in the specified location and has the expected structure for the application to function correctly.
